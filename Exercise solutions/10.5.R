
# Task 1: What are the types of data and the levels of measurement of the following variables: Cust ID, Mortgage, Year of sale. 
# Task 2: Create a histogram which represents the Price variable. Use the default binwidth values first and then set bins of length $100,000. Use the data on all apartments, no matter if sold or not.
# Task 3: Interpret the results.
# Task 4: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between Price and Area. Use the data on all apartments, no matter if sold or not. Interpret the results.
# Task 5: Calculate the mean, median, mode, skewness, and standard deviation of Price for all apartments, no matter if sold or not.
# Task 6: Interpret the measures.
# Task 7: Calculate the correlation between Price and Area. Is the result in line with the scatterplot?

# Task 1

# Cust ID - Categorical/Nominal. This variable has the same properties as ID.
# Mortgage - Categorical/Nominal.	This is a Binary variable. Like a Yes/No question or Gender.
# Year of sale - Numerical, discrete/Interval.	Year is a numerical variable. It is always discrete. The level of measurement is questionable, but we would treat it as interval, as the 0 year would be the time when the Big Bang happened. The current BC-AD calendar was arbitrary chosen (similarly to degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit).

# Task 3

# The two histograms point to similar insights - most of the apartment prices are concentrated in the interval ($217,000 to 317,000)	

# Task 4

# The scatter plot shows a very strong linear relationship between Price and Area. This was to be expected as often Real Estate companies price their property per square foot.	
# Notice how for cheaper apartments (lower areas respectively), the points are closer so the variance is smaller. However, the bigger the apartment, the bigger the difference in the price.

# Task 6

# We will only comment on the skew, as it is a bit tougher. 
# The skew is right (positive). This means that most aparments are relatively cheap with a tiny portion that is more expensive.														

# Task 7

cor.test(product$`Area (ft.)`, product$Price)

# Yes, the result is in line with the scatter plot. The two variables are strongly correlated.
