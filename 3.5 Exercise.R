# Before we continue, make sure you know what objects you have in your environment. Use a function to get a list of the object in your environment ????

# Create a variable called lvl that contains the following values:  8, 10, 10, 1, 10, 10, 8, 12, 1, 12.

# Use the commands listed below to do the following operations:
  
#Find the sum of the elements in lvl
#Find the average of the elements in lvl
#Find the median value (the middle value) of the elements in lvl
#Get R to return the length of the lvl variable
#Find the standard deviation of the values in lvl
#Find the standard deviation of the elements in lvl, then round it; do it in a single command
#Find the standard deviation of the elements in lvl, then round it, then specifically ask R to print it; do it in a single command
#Functions to use: sum(), mean(), median(), length(), sd(), round(), print()

# Tip: when typing code in the console and you want to run different commands on the same object, use the Up Arrow to access the last command you executed, and simply edit the function call, keeping the rest the same.
