# A health guru on the internet designed a weight-loss program. 
# You are wondering if it is working. You are given a sample of some people who did the program. 
# You can find the data in kg if you prefer working with kg as a unit of measurement.

# State the null hypothesis.
# Calculate the appropriate statistic
# Decide if this is a one-sided or a two-sided test. What is the p-value?
# Based on the p-value, decide at 1%,5% and 10% significance, if the program is working. Comment using the appropriate statistical jargon.
