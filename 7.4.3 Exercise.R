# Download the employees dataset from the resources for this lesson.

# Then, import it into R using your preferred import method.

# This is a large dataset, so limit the import to 200 observations. Note that the dataset has Copyright information in the beginning (23 rows). Any character variables should be stored as characters.

# Rename the variables as follows: "Employee number", "First name", "Last name", "Birth date", "Gender", "Job title", "Salary", "From date", "To date".

# Export the data set you currently have as a CSV, without saving the row names.

# Import it back again to make sure everything is okay.

# If it is, great job!
