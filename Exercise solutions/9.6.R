# The aes(x = gender, fill = title) mapping is a lot more difficult to read;
# the only thing it makes relatively easy for me to see is that the data is too symmetrially distributed, which
# suggests it has indeed been artifically generated (shocker!)

# look up scale_fill_manual, and scale_color_manual functions
# Can you set title and x and y axis names? Why? Try using a different theme. Can you do it now? 
# What happens if you try to set the theme() argument legend.position = "right". Why do you think that is? 
# Change the mappings so that gender is plotted and the bars are filled with position segmentation. 
# Do you find this graph useful and easy to read? 
# Perhaps the only thing it convinces us in is that the data has been simulated.
