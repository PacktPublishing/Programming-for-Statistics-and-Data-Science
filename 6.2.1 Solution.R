 ########## Bonus exercise: ##########
 
 # Imagine the following: Your mother announced yesteday that she's going to win the lottery. She did it with the casual
 # nonchalance of a person who's going to the shop to pick up some pasta. Today is the number draw. 
 # If she gets 6 numbers correct, she wins the lottery. If she doesn't get 6 numbers correct, she will sit staring 
 # at the screen wondering how on earth she did not manage to achive this very simple task.
 
 # Write a statement that will print "Mom wins the lottery!" if the six numbers she guessed matched the lottery numbers,
 # and "Mom did not win the lottery." if the numbers do not match.
 
 # Hint: it will be best if you create one object with randomly generated numbers, and another object which you populate
 # manually (as if you're playing the lottery), and compare the two. 
 
 # Hint: look into the length() and setdiff() functions 
 
 ########## SOLUTION ##########
 
 # Create a vector containing the numbers that mom chose for the lottery (any numbers)
 
 myinputs <- c(4,5,9,15,18,22) 
 
 # Create a vector that stores the lottery results: use sample() to generate 6 random 
 # numbers between 1 and 49, without replacement
 
 lottery <- sample(1:49,6,replace=F)
 
 # If mom guessed the lottery numbers, the myinputs and lottery vectors will be the same
 # One way to confirm that they are the same, is to subtract one vector from the other.
 # If the result is zero, then the two vectors are identical, and mom guessed the lotttery.
 
 # You can use the setdiff() function to check this.
 # Setdif() returns a vector with the difference between two vectors.
 # In this case we need the difference between the lottery numbers and what mom picked.
 
 # The length() function gets the SIZE of a vector. 
 # So, if mom guessed all numbers, then setdiff() would be empty.
 # If setdiff() is empty, the length() function would return zero.
 
 wrongGuesses <- length(setdiff(lottery, myinputs)) 
 
 # Then you just need to create the if statement.
 # It should check if the length function returned zero, and if it did, mom won the lottery
 
 if(wrongGuesses == 0){
   print("Mom won the lottery!")
 } else {
   print("Mom did not win the lottery.")
 }
