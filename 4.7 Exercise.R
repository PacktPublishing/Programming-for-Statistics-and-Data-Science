# Create a vector s that stores the number sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30. Use the seq() command to do that.

# Check the attributes of s.

# Does it have any dimensions?
  
# Give it dimensions. Try specifying 3 rows and 5 columns.

# What happens if we try to go beyond the traditional height and width properties and specify a value for depth, too. Let's create a hypercube that has 1 row, 3 columns and 5 "slices".

# Try assigning the following dimensions to s: 1, 3, 5.

# Can you do more than that? Do you think this could be useful for something?
